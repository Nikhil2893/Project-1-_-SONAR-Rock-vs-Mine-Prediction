# Project 1 : SONAR Rock Vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Introduction 

The focus of this project will be the Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset. The problem is to predict metal or rock objects from sonar return data. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The label associated with each record contains the letter R if the object is a rock and M if it is a mine (metal cylinder). The numbers in the labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the angle directly.

We are going to cover the following steps:

## Installation

[No Installation is required to run the code as No UI app is created in this one. The predictive system can run on Google Colaboratory.
Please open the **"Project 1 _ LogisticRegression_SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb"** file with the help of Google Colaboratory]
